# URL Shortener Application

**Overview**  
The URL Shortener Application is a Python Django project that provides users with a simple interface to shorten long URLs, making them easier to share and manage. This application enhances user convenience by allowing for quick access to lengthy web addresses through concise links.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. Download the latest version from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended): Creating a virtual environment helps isolate project dependencies. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv


Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command:

    python -m venv myenv


This will create a new virtual environment named "myenv" in your project directory.

Activate the virtual environment: Activate the virtual environment you created. The process for activating the virtual environment depends on your operating system:

On Windows:

    myenv\Scripts\activate

    
 On macOS/Linux:
    
    source myenv/bin/activate
    
    
## Running it 

     python manage.py runserver
