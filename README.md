# About the project 
Enable a virtual environment 

# Steps of setting up 
Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version from the official Python website (https://www.python.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended): It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project to keep its dependencies isolated. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command:
python -m venv myenv

This will create a new virtual environment named "myenv" in your project directory.
Activate the virtual environment: Activate the virtual environment you created. The process for activating the virtual environment depends on your operating system:

    On Windows:
     
    myenv\Scripts\activate
    
    On macOS/Linux:
    
    source myenv/bin/activate
